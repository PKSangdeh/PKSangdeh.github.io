      <div class="description">
        <p>
         This paper investigates the use of capsule networks (CapsNets) as an alternative to CNNs. We show that CapsNets significantly outperforms CNNs when the number of training samples is small. To increase the computational efficiency, our paper proposes a consistent dynamic routing mechanism that results in 3x speedup of CapsNet. Finally, we show that the original image reconstruction method of CapNets performs poorly on lung nodule data. We propose an efficient alternative, called convolutional decoder, that yields lower reconstruction error and higher classification accuracy.

      <div class="description">
        <p>
	we investigate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for lung nodule classification in computed tomography scans. Using less than 10,000 training examples, deep networks perform 4.8 times better than a standard radiology software under the cross-error measure. Our paper also proposes a novel framework for rapidly adapting deep networks to the radiologists' feedback, or change in the data due to the shift in sensor's resolution or patient population. The classification accuracy of our approach remains above 80\% while popular deep networks' accuracy is around chance. Finally, we propose using inconsistency density function, computed by a recurrent network, as a way to discover potentially noisy labels in lung data.

We planned several activities aiming to help people to save
energy. We designed a program and asked volunteers to perform
those activities at their homes for 3 months. We have access to
monthly electricity bills for all the program’s participants. Our
investigation revealed that energy savings among participants has
close relationship to level of their engagement into the program.
People who were highly involved into program saved much more
energy (5%) compare to participants who did not engage enough.

In this work, we investigated several approaches to accurately initialize real time clocks with sub-second accuracy.
Our experiments show by accurately initializing real time clocks, a time synchronized sensor network can be built without any energy or 
complexity overhead of running sophisticated time synchronization protocol.

        Human brain has a high potential process capacity and we want to utilize it to build an anti-phishing solution. Our way to reach to interact with brain is through its outputs. In this work, we attach several sensors (Gaze Tracker, SPO2, Airflow, Heart Rate and ...) to human body and asked our participants to distinguish Phishing emails from original ones. We are interested in common patterns among our participants.
